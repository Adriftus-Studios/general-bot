## Contributing To our Project

Please see our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Adriftus-Studios/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a basic grounds on getting started with our project.


## Installing Python

### Installing Python on Windows

- Check if python is already installed
  - Open Command Prompt with <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> then type and run `cmd`
  - If you see something to the effect of:
```
Python 3.10.5 (tags/v3.10.5:f377153, Jun  6 2022, 16:14:13) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
  then you already have python installed. Exit the python interpreter by typing `exit()`
  
  - If you do no see the above, then you must download python. Navigate to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the `Download Python x.x` button.
  - Follow all recomended values.

### Installing Python on Mac

- Check if python is already installed
  - Same as for Windows, you should open your Mac Terminal. You can do this by searching for `Terminal` in your finder.
  - Inside your terminal, type: `python -V` (uppercase **V**)
  - You should see something to the effect of:
```
#/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/codecs.pyc
```
  The most important thing you're looking for here is that there is **any** version 3.8 or higher. 
  
  - If you do no see the above, then you must download python. Navigate to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the `Download Python x.x` button.
  - Follow all recomended values.
 
 ### Installing Python on Linux
 
 - Trick question! Python comes pre-loaded on most linux distros. 
 
   You should still check that your version is 3.8 or higher though. To do this, type `python3 --version`
   
 
   After you have installed python on your OS, check if you have pip (The package manager installed) 
 
 	If not, simply run: `curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10` in your terminal, ensuring that you change the python version after the last pipe.
 
 ## Installing Github Desktop
 
 ### Installing and Cloning from Github Desktop
 
 - Installing:
   - You should navigate to [Adriftus - Getting Started](https://github.com/Adriftus-Studios/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started) if you have not already. But if you have, and just need a refresher, then you can visit [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to download the application.
   - Once installed, move on to the next section, Cloning.
 
 - Cloning:
   - To configure Github Desktop, you should start by cloning a repository. You can do this by clicking the green `Code` button at the top of the page:
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22847483/173702681-0550d446-6eb9-44d9-8c31-6c2b8512053d.png)

   - You should be prompted with a local path. You can make this anything you want, though it's recomended to keep this somewhere stable (ie, the desktop). Preferably not on a flash drive or removable storage unless you know what you're doing. 
   - That's it! You've cloned the repo!
